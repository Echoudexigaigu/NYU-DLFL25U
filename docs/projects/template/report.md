## 1. Problem and Motivation (≈ 1 minute)
What concept is being tested?
Why is it non-obvious or interesting?

## 2. Hypothesis (≈ 30 seconds)
State a single, precise hypothesis.
Explain what outcome would support or refute it.

## 3. Experimental Design (≈ 2 minutes)
- Model(s) used
- Dataset or synthetic setup
- What is varied and what is held fixed
- Why this experiment is sufficient to test the hypothesis

## 4. Results (≈ 2 minutes)
- Key figures or tables only
- No raw logs
- Describe what happened, not why (yet)

## 5. Analysis (≈ 2 minutes)
Interpret the results.
Connect them to the underlying theory (perceptron, gradient descent, CNNs, RNNs, attention, etc.).

## 6. Conclusion / Teaching Moment (≈ 1 minute)
What did we learn?
What misconception does this clarify?
What would change if assumptions were violated?

## 7. Limitations (optional, ≤ 1 minute)
One or two honest limitations of the experiment.
