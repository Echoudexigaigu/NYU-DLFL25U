# NYU introduction to Deep Learning, Fall 2025, Undergrad edition (NYU-DLFL25U)

This repository hosts my new course, introduction to Deep Learning research for undergraduates.
The aim of this course is to get the students fluent in reasoning, using:

 - maths (linear algebra, calculus, logic),
 - diagrams and schematics (abstract graphical language),
 - graphs (function plotting and asymtotic behaviour),
 - physics (reducing systems to their base parts to identify emerging collective behaviours), and
 - coding (empirical verification of proposed hypothesis).

A playlist with all lecture will eventually come online as companion to this repo and its website.
This repo will host:

 - said website (with a table of contents and suggested readings), 
 - the code of the best final projects created by the students, and
 - the project description and key findings (as part of the website).
